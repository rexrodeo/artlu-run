            <h2>What We Collect</h2>
            <p>When you purchase a race plan, we collect your name, email address, training city/state, and race goal time. Payment is processed securely through Stripe — we never see or store your credit card number.</p>
            <h2>How We Use It</h2>
            <p>Your information is used to build your personalized race plan and to send you your access code and plan-ready notification. We don't sell or share your data with third parties.</p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>We use a session cookie to keep you logged into your dashboard. No tracking cookies or third-party analytics are used.</p>
            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Your purchase records and race plans are retained so you can access them anytime. If you'd like your data deleted, email us at <a href="mailto:vonrexroad@gmail.com">vonrexroad@gmail.com</a>.</p>
