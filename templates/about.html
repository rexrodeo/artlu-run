            <p>ARTLU.RUN builds personalized race strategy for ultramarathon runners. We analyze course profiles, local training terrain, and race-day conditions to give you a concrete plan — not generic advice.</p>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Every race plan starts with the course. We break it into sections, identify the key challenges, and match each section to Strava training segments near your city. Then we layer in pacing strategy, nutrition timing, gear recommendations, and lessons from past finishers.</p>
            <p>The result is a plan you can actually train with: specific segments to run, a pace chart for race day, and a playbook for the hardest sections of the course.</p>
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>We're ultra runners who got tired of training blind. We built the tool we wished existed — personalized, data-driven race prep that goes deeper than "just run more."</p>
